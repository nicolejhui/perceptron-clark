# Python Basics
*Small assignments completed during my first and second week at the [Clark Summer Research Program](https://honors.utdallas.edu/clark-summer-research-program) at the University of Texas at Dallas. These assignments were done in preperation for the [mushroom decision tree assignment](https://github.com/nicolejhui/mushroom_decision_tree).*

I had minimal computer science experience prior to the beginning of the program. Remember, no matter how new you are to computer science and coding, you can and will be able to learn like I did (and I'm still learning!).
